# Template for projects using Lunaris
*Start your project with this template! It's recommended to update the submodule (probably) if there's any update.*<br>
*This template uses the built-in test available on Lunaris itself (used by it). You can just compile and test all modules easily with that.*<br>
*Reference to Lunaris [here](https://www.github.com/Lohkdesgds/Lunaris)*
